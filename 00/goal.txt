Scale an input PNM by an integer multiple, producing a PNM output.

Your program should take 1-3 arguments:
  * a positive integer, to be taken as the scale multiple
  * a filename of an existing PNM file, the input.  If this is missing, use STDIN
  * a filename for the PNM output.  If this is missing, use STDOUT.

Convert a "plain" PNM to a "packed" PNM.

Your program should take exactly 2 arguments:
  * input filename of plain PNM
  * output filename of packed PNM

Note that the point of this exercise is to begin to cultivate a little experience in bit-packing and
other binary format manipulation.

If this doesn't seem like enough of a stretch, feel free to try saving GIFs or JPEGs or PNGs or
something else, and I look forward to seeing you when you get back from that.

# gfx-fnd-tests
Automated tests for Graphics Fundamentals lectures

Assignments are primarily verbal, but there should be a little hint for each exercise in ##/goal.txt

You should be able to just `git pull` this repo, and run something like

`./run_tests MY_PROG_NAME TASK_NUMBER`

For example, if you have written a program called `magnify` that you believe satisfies the
requirements for Task #0, you can run all tests with

`./run_tests magnify 0`

or just tests #2 and #3 with

`./run_tests magnify 0 2 3`

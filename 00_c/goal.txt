Make a native-style PNM-viewing application

Figure out some plan to view PNMs in a native-style app on your platform.  The point here is not to
produce a viewer (existing viewers do fine, thank you).  The point is to start making progress on a
path that eventually leads to an interactive application that can display images almost as fast as
it can generate them, so that when your 3D engine is finished, you can interactively look at scenes
in it.  Of course, at that point it won't read PNMs, but rather you'll write directly to the
screen-drawing API that you develop, rather than writing to a PNM intermediary.

I haven't even *started* looking at how to do this on any platform, so I'm hoping students will
solve this one for me.  Obviously the difficulty level will depend on a variety of things, like
programming language, willingness to include dependencies, and performance goals.

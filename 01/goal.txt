Write a black line on a white field.

Your program should take 3 arguments, like this:
PROGNAME 8x7 1,2 3,4

That should generate a P1-type PNM, with width 8 and height 7, with a line running from 1,2 (near
the top-left corner) to 6,5 (near the bottom-right).  Note that, as with much computer graphics, I
assume that 0,0 is the top-left pixel.  To be clear, in high-school math terms, that line should
have a "rise" of -3, and a "run" of 5, and thus a "slope" of -0.6.

All output files should be in P1 format, with the line in black (1) and the other pixels in white (0).

The line should be of thickness 1, and should not be aliased or any other fancy-schmancy nonsense.
Though if you can alias it nicely, that'd be cool too.  But it won't help you pass the autotests.

Also for clarity, note that the line from 1,1 to 1,3 actually covers up 3 pixels, because both
endpoints are filled in.

Make a Javascript tool to read PNMs from a textarea and display them somehow.

Ideally it should also allow a scaling factor, because it'll make it a lot easier to audit your own
work on the early assignments.

Personally I think it'd be pretty funny to use a <table> of 1x1 pixel <div> elements, and give each
one a background color.  YMMV.  Obviously if you care about performance, there's this silly thing
called <canvas>

As with 00_c, the "PNM-viewer" goal is only a means to an end; eventually I hope that we can port
our 3d engines to the browser, because it's an interactive environment that all of us (are supposed
to) know.
